"Kittens are Dying"

That call to action was an overly dramatic portrayal of the stabbing pain I
feel every time a newcomer to our field of web development searches the Web for
help. The search results for anything related to beginner level web development
flat out suck. For years we've been getting results like this:

Where I hate on W3Schools for a Moment.

W3Schools has been hitting the top of Google search results from seemingly day
1 of the search engines.  Well, since 1999 anyway.  Any one of us would be
lying if we said we didn't learn plenty of web development from that site when
we were getting started.  However, without any comprehensive learning material
to back up all that search engine fodder, much of what I learned from in my
W3Schools days, I had to unlearn later. I never really understood it, and got
confused about a lot of the reasoning and implementation while stumbling around
on my own for a few years.

And, with all the advertising, the use of Microsoft ASP, and the tight layout,
it just feels "icky". They hit the top of all the search results, but don't seem
to really be making an honest effort to move the craft of web development forward.

To W3Schools' credit though, there are much worse things out there. I mean,
Tutorial Point seems to think that Java programming students look like this:

I mean, I know we need more women in software development, but that's just
insulting &mdash; to men and women.

I began learning web development during my senior year of college in 2000 - 2001.
At that time web development was not a "real" focus of study, and I had to
complete all my "real" coursework before I could take the web classes. When I
finally got there we learned the Adobe flash tools and Dreamweaver, but not
HTML, CSS, PHP, or JavaScript. For two years out of college I built websites
using the Flash toolset. I quit for a while, and didn't get back into it until
2007 when I finally learned PHP, on my own. A large part of my education came
from that pile of crap at the top of the search results page, and yeah, am
still resentful. It's a stretch to call it a waste of time, but I could
certainly have saved a lot of time learning the wrong stuff and confusing
myself had I found the right learning material sooner.

After getting a few years of web development experience under my belt I
discovered the Mozilla Developers site. I got involved in building Firefox
addons, which really pushed my front end development capabilities in a good
way. And, I learned what open source software development was all about besides
"free", which was a huge leap forward for me.

## State of the Union

Today, there is much more positive stuff going on in the teaching, and learning of web
development as a craft. There is also a very healthy movement going to expound the virtues
of learning to code, even for people who don't plan on being developers as their primary
career. Basic web development is getting recognition as a powerful tool to have on your belt.
Some recent, good reading includes
[Code, the newsroom, and self-doubt](http://veltman.tumblr.com/post/56132893301/code-the-newsroom-and-self-doubt)
by [Noah Veltman](http://veltman.tumblr.com/), and
[Why every entrepreneur needs to learn to code (something)](https://medium.com/architecting-a-life/c2b101b71ff3)
by [Joelle Steiniger](https://twitter.com/JoelleSteiniger).

And supporting the "learn to code" movement, online tools and courseware have
improved dramatically since I first got started.  Like, night and day.  These
days, when I ask where to send a newbie to learn web development I get answers
like:

* http://teamtreehouse.com/
* https://tutsplus.com/
* http://code.org/
* http://css-tricks.com/lodge/ 
* http://www.codeschool.com/ 
* https://peepcode.com/ 
* http://learncodethehardway.org/ 

These are really great resources, and I highly recommend them, however, they
don't rank high in the search results. Like it or not, the googles is the
gateway to the craft of web development, and anything more than an incremental
improvement in learning needs to rank well to have an impact.

## Where We Invent the Future

So the plan is to create a site, which I'm calling The HTML and CSS Tutorial,
with the goal of winning the search engine battle for beginner level web
development material.  To do this it needs to have the best learning material
on the web (or close to it), along with comprehensive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
reference material.  To do this The HTML and CSS Tutorial needs to provide high
quality content coupled with an information architecture that will get a
beginner up to speed, meeting their immediate needs, while allowing them to go
through a comprehensive course of material when they are ready.

When I started working on it, I thought it would just be a big HTML "book"
which anyone could read online. However, as I've seen the power of video,
especially for people who learn better visually, I've decided that it needs to
include video as well. So, it's going to end up as an online reference book (in HTML),
a collection of cheat sheets, use case specific guides, and a catalog of
courses including video. There will be no paywall in front of the core content,
which will be hosted on GitHub, and it would be great to include links to all
the great courseware I mentioned above as well.

I know this is starting to sound like another labor of love, where I now ask
you to hit the donation button at the top of the page and contribute to a
GitHub repository. Actually, I hope to make a living by selling high quality
video tutorials and other material outside of all the awesomeness you can get
for free here at The HTML and CSS tutorial. I plan on making a living at this
someday; with your help.

It's going to take forever to get there, but waiting is not going to do
anything to help the current situation.  We've been waiting for too long
already.  So, I'm going to get started publishing and promoting now, and I'm
going to need your help to do it.

I also know that HTML and CSS Tutorial isn't going to win the game on the backs
of beginners.  The site needs to be promoted and linked to by you, the more
seasoned developers, and the only way to do that is with quality content worth
reading, viewing, and linking to. So, intermediate and advanced material is
also on the docket in the near future, just for you.

I'll have much more detail about the short term strategy and tactics for
launching this project in my next post sometime next week. Until then, tell all
your developer friends to come check it out.
